Bamazon is an amazon-like, CLI store app.

As a customer, the app will let you order items from the store. 

As a manager, you can add new products and replenish inventory for depleted items. 

As a supervisor, you can track product sales across departments and provide 
a summary of the highest-grossing categories in the store.
